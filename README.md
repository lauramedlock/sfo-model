# SFO Neuron Model
Tonic and burst firing SFO model as published in JNeurophysiology:

Medlock L, Shute L, Fry M, Standage D, Ferguson AV. Ionic mechanisms underlying tonic and burst firing behavior in subfornical organ neurons: a combined experimental and modeling study. J Neurophysiol. 2018 Nov 1;120(5):2269-2281.

## Extra Code:
> ang-tnf-kca-ca --> replaced the IKS current in the original SFO model with a calcium-dependent K+ current (IKCA)
>> presented at Canadian Association for Neuroscience (CAN) 2018

> sfo-svm-classifier --> support vector machine that allows you to predict whether an SFO neuron will respond to ANG-II
>> presented in Computational Neuroscience Keystone Project (Queen's University, 2018)
